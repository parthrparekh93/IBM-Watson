Second, to teach enough about database engine internals (e.g., physical database design, query optimization, transaction processing) so you have a good sense of why queries may be running slowly/incorrectly. Students are expected to be comfortable with data structures and Python.$ 614$ SCH $ MW 2:40pm-3:55pm $ MW 4pm
