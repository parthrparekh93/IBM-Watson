Paisley $ Electrical Engineering $ 422 $ MUDD $Bayesian Models for Machine Learning $ EECS E6720 $  This intermediate-level machine learning course will focus on Bayesian approaches to machine learning. Topics will include mixed-membership models, latent factor models and Bayesian nonparametric methods. We will also focus on mean-field variational Bayesian inference, an optimization-based approach to approximate posterior learning. Applications of these methods include image processing, topic modeling, collaborative filtering and recommendation systems. We will discuss a selection of these in class. $ 417 $ International Affairs Building $ Thursday 4:10-6:40pm $ Monday 11am-1pm
Eugene Wu$ Computer Science$ 421$ MUD$ Introduction to Databases$ coms4111$ The goal of this class is two-fold. First, to introduce you to core database concepts (e.g., data modeling, logical design, SQL) so that you too can build a billion dollar application. Second, to teach enough about database engine internals (e.g., physical database design, query optimization, transaction processing) so you have a good sense of why queries may be running slowly/incorrectly. Students are expected to be comfortable with data structures and Python.$ 614$ Schermerhorn$ MW 2:40pm-3:55pm $ MW 4pm

Rocco Servedio$Computer Science$401$Mud$Introduction to Computational Learning Theory$coms 4252$This course will give an introduction to some of the central topics in computational learning theory, a field which approaches the above question from a theoretical computer science perspective. We will study well-defined mathematical and computational models of learning in which it is possible to give precise and rigorous analyses of learning problems and learning algorithms. A big focus of the course will be the computational efficiency of learning in these models. We'll develop computationally efficient algorithms for certain learning problems, and will see why efficient algorithms are not likely to exist for other problems.$702$Hamilton$Tues/Thurs 8:40-9:55$Fri 9:30-11:30
